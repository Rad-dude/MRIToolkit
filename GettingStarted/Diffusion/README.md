# MRIToolkit - Diffusion processing examples [update 14-03-2020] 

These examples show how to use the MATLAB toolbox to perform common processing steps. The same examples will soon be shown for the command line tools as well.

An [example dataset](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/kAYfZ0xugHKOC4t) is made available for convenience. Please note that this example is for test only - **do not publish or redistribute this dataset without consent**.
